*AI and NLP Researcher @ Drexel University*

Welcome! 

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Information Science, and a member of the [Tex-Base Lab](https://drexel.edu/cci/research/centers-labs/TeX-Base%20Lab/) at Drexel University. I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Rosina Weber](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~rw37/). I received my M.S. in Information Science at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 (advised by Prof. [Yue (Ray) Wang](https://ils.unc.edu/~wangyue/)) and B.S. in Management Information Systems at Dalian University of Technology in 2019. 

My current research interests include **Interpretable Machine Learning**, **Large Language Model Reasoning**, and **Trustworthy AI Systems**. My ongoing projects specifically focus on developing prototype-based networks that enhance model interpretability without sacrificing performance, and designing safety-aligned LLM systems through efficient reinforcement learning from human feedback. This involves integrating domain knowledge with deep learning architectures and leveraging explainable AI techniques that align with expert reasoning processes. Besides, I am also interested in fine-tuning and deploying vision-language models for real-world applications, particularly in healthcare and e-commerce domains.
